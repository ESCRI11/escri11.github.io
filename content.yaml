about: >
  As an Engineer and Bioinformatician, my expertise lies in creating products
  that prioritize meticulous attention to detail and high performance.
  My professional journey has spanned both private and academic sectors,
  equipping me with versatile experience for efficiently executing tasks
  in diverse environments. My technical proficiency extends across various domains,
  including DevOps (with skills in Docker and Linux system management) and R for
  bioinformatics and data analysis, with a particular emphasis on R Shiny.
  I am constantly seeking new technical challenges; currently, I am learning
  to deploy using infrastructure as code approaches. In the academic sphere,
  I have made notable contributions to significant publications and have presented
  at conferences, demonstrating my capacity to effectively communicate complex concepts.
  I excel in roles that require innovation, teamwork, and intricate problem-solving skills.
